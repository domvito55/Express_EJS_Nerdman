                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p> My name is Matheus Vinicius Ferreira Figueiredo Teixeira.
                    I am a student of software engineering, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, but
                    I also bring with me a professional background in mechatronics engineering,
                    having worked in NASA (USA), where I had the opportunity to develop software in
                    Python, as well as various experiences within control and automation. I believe my
                    technical aptitude, critical thinking skills and personal attributes will be a
                    valuable addition to any team.
                    </p>

                <h2>Career</h2>
                <img src="./images/NASA.png" alt="profile picture" height="200px"  style="float:right;margin:1em">
                <p>
                    During my Bachelor of Engineering degree, I completed numerous software development
                    courses and projects, using Assembly and C language under Linux environment, with a
                    comprehensive one-year project using C. Through my work ethic and academic
                    performance, I was granted an internship at NASA, where, I have learned Python and
                    developed software for the onboard computer on the BOBCAT mission. Following this,
                    I proceeded with building automation, using GCL+ language, Modbus, and BACnet objects
                    and networks, implementing automation and access control systems for huge sites such
                    as a three-tower bank headquarters; using either MySQL or SQL server, I have also
                    implemented the databases and connected them to the access and automation systems, to
                    hold, for example, visitors and employeeâ€™s information. For these systems, I have
                    implemented the graphical user interface as well.

                    <p>
                        Most recently, I decided to focus my career on software development, and have
                        enrolled in Software Engineering Technology - Artificial Intelligence Advanced
                        Diploma. I have completed projects in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and shell script,
                        achieving A+ scores across these courses. Currently, I am working with Node.JS,
                        Angular, Express, Java, and Introduction to AI, in Python. Lastly, I am working as
                        a Student Researcher, developing code in VHDL for a Landing Gear Controller. In any
                        of my professional pursuits, I have consistently been commended for my keen ability
                        to learn new skills. I made the code of some of the projects that I have developed
                        available at my personal GitHub. One can also see some of the code I have written
                        running live here.
